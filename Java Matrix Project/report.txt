Sorting Algorithm
I used a merge sort algorithm for the sorting aspect of my program. This algorithm 
has an average, best, and worse case time complexity of O(n log n). The merge 
sort algorithm breaks down the initial list into many smaller lists then 
merges and sorts them. The time complexity is O(n log n) as a result of the 
recursion that is utilised in the algorithm. 

Adding Algorithm
The algorithm that I used has a worst case time complexity of O(N1+N2). 
This is because I have used only two loops, and they are not nested, with one
being of size N1 and the other size N2. As these are not necessarily the same
size, we cannot claim the complexity to be O(N).
